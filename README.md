# The ECS Test!
- Ensure that line 26 of "Test_base.java" contains path to your config file in full, and line 45 has the path to your chromedriver executable - I have pushed a version of chromedriver to this repo but feel free to use another.
- Ensure Maven's auto-import is enabled, which should take care of the dependencies.
- Selenium is unfortunately not able to run docker containers so they will have to be spun up manually.
- Run from "Cukes.java" and away it goes!
